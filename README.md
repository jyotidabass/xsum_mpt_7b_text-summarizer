## Application Side of This Work

This repository contains a notebook for generating summaries of YouTube video comments using the OpenAI ChatGPT Text-davinci-003 model. I conducted experiments with different temperature values to assess the quality of the generated summaries. You can access the results in the "Application" folder, specifically in the "youtube-comment-summarizer.ipynb" file.
